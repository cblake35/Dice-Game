# Dice-Game
A small DOM practice/challenge web app

## Information
-The purpose of this project is to practice using DOM manipulation
using JavaScript. The app consists of a simple HTML file wherein
the task is to change the image of the dice to correspond with the 
random number generated by a function. 

-A conditional statement will then check which dice have a higher 
value and announces the winner, or if it's a draw upon reloading the
page.
